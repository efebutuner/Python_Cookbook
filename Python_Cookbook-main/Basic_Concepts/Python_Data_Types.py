#Numbers (int and float)
print(2 + 4)
print(2 - 4)
print(2 * 4)
print(2 / 4) # = float as 2 divided by 4 is 0.5

print(type(2 + 4)) # Type function returns the data type of the variable or the statement inside its brackets
print(type(10.56)) # Floating point numbers are stored in 2 different places inside the memory where first location stores the numbers before dot and second point stores the numbers after the dot

print(2 ** 2) # Two to the power of two
print(10 // 4) # Remainder of divison
print(5 % 4) # Remainder of division

# Math Functions
print(round(3.1))
print(abs(-5))
